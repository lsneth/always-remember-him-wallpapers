# Overview

This is an app that provides wallpapers of Jesus Christ. It's purpose is to help people remember Christ in their every day lives. I am creating this project to get a basic understanding of Android Studio and practice Java. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

* Put in better wallpapers (the ones there now look kinda sketch)
* Add a back arrow on the fullscreen activity (right now you have to use the Android System navigation to go back)
* Have a 'daily wallpaper' option that automatically sets a new wallpaper every day
* Get the images dynamically from a folder, then later get them dynamically from a database. (Currently they are hardcoded.)
* Optimize the UI for every Android experience. (The UI is currently optimized for a Google Pixel 5.)
* Create a standard wallpaper setter UI. (drag/resize, set home screen or lock screen or both)
* Upload it to the Google Play Store
