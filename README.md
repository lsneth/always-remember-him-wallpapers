# Overview

I am creating this app to get a basic understanding of Android Studio and practice Java.

This is an app that provides wallpapers of Jesus Christ. Simply download the app, choose a wallpaper, and select "Set Wallpaper!"

The purpose of this app is to help people remember Christ in their every day lives.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

* Get the images dynamically from a folder, then later get them dynamically from a database. (Currently they are hardcoded.)
* Optimize the UI for every Android experience. (The UI is currently optimized for a Google Pixel 5.)
* Upload it to the Google Play Store
